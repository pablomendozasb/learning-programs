  <h2> The composition of Sweater </h2>
  <p>
    Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from
    Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important
    components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature,
    dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and PH. These
    elements vary in their composition as well in their influence on marine life.
