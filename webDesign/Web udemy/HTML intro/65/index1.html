    <h1>Computer programming</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Computer programming is the process of performing a particular <a href="#nowhere">computation</a> (or more generally,
        accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer 
        program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' 
        accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen 
        programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written 
        in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is 
        directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence 
        of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating 
        system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires 
        expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized 
        algorithms, and formal logic.

    <h3>Machine language</h3>

    <p>
        Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular 
        machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer 
        specify instruction in a text format (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation 
        code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little 
        more than a different notation for a machine language, two machines with different instruction sets 
        also have different assembly languages.
    </p>

    <h3>Compiler languages</h3>

    <p>
        High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, 
        and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was 
        developed in 1952[12] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[13][14] FORTRAN, the 
        first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[15] 
        and many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data 
        processing, and Lisp for computer research.

    <h3>Source code entry</h3>

    <p>
        Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage 
        devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing 
        directly into the computers. Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections 
        to be made much more easily than with punched cards.
